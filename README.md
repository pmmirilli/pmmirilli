I actually had to learn Markdown to write this file! ...

### A few lines about my story as a programmer

I am an engineer, seeking to reposition myself in the IT field. I have always been into computers and tech stuff.  
I started off by learning a bit of C during college and enjoyed it right from the start. Prior to that, I had no clue as to how software was made. After that, I had a few experiences with VBA (in Excel, as one would guess) and then some with C# (in Unity, who would have thought?).  
Making it short, I decided it was time to move on from engineering and started learning some stuff at [Free Code Camp](https://freeCodeCamp.org) (thanks, guys!). Some guy (his-link-here) then found me and told me to learn Angular. I complied. I started [a course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (thanks, man!) and am now coding my way through it.

To be continued...

---------------------------------

... As it turns out, Markdown goes against my OCD, in that I have to leave two whitespaces after a line to make a break. My therapist will have to hear about this.

### My aspirations

+ Be great at what I do
+ Help other people achieve the same
+ Spend time with my awesome kid
+ Live among wolves
